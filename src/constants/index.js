        description:"Implemented Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) reinforcement learning algorithms to develop an simulated autonomous drone system capable of stabilization and precise movement. Utilized these algorithms to build and train the droneâ€™s policy network with Pytorch, to optimize its actions on custom environment feedback. Its performance is optimized over time by incorporating reward and value functions.",

Extracted historical stock price data using the OpenBB Terminal SDK, and preprocessed it by dividing it into nonoverlapping windows of 4 days closing prices to forecast the next days price. Employed a variety of architectures, including LSTM+Dense, RNN+Dense, and Dense-only models, using a window of the past 4 days closing prices to predict the next days price for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. Achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.8 percent with the best-performing architecture.",
